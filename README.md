## Quick start

Application (include emulator, assembler and debugger)
can work without any server or database service. Just
download source code, and run script. You need node
and yarn to download dependencies and run application.

```bash
$ git clone https//github.com/rokkerruslan/i8080 && cd i8080
$ ./app start
```

You see host/port when local dev server starts.
